README: Integrating AI with Spring using Ollama with Mistral AI

->Overview
This README provides guidance on integrating artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities into a Spring application using Ollama with Mistral AI. Ollama is a lightweight Java library for integrating AI models into applications, and Mistral AI provides powerful AI capabilities. By following this guide, you'll be able to enhance your Spring application with advanced AI functionalities.

->Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
Maven or Gradle installed for dependency management (Maven is used in this guide).
Access to the Mistral AI platform and an API key for authentication.

->Integration Steps
Step 1: Set up your Spring application
If you haven't already set up your Spring application, create a new project using Spring Initializr or use an existing one.

Step 2: Add Ollama Dependency
In your pom.xml file, add the Ollama dependency:
<dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework.ai</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-ai-ollama-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
</dependency>

Step 3: Configure Mistral AI
In your Spring application properties (application.properties or application.yml), add your Mistral AI:
spring.ai.ollama.base-url=http://localhost:11434
spring.ai.ollama.chat.options.model=llama3
spring.ai.ollama.chat.options.temperature=0.7

Step 4: Create an AI service
Create a new Java class for your AI service. This service will interact with Ollama and Mistral AI to perform AI tasks. 

Step 5: Test the integration
Run your Spring application and test the AI functionality by sending requests to the appropriate endpoint.

->Conclusion
By following these steps, you have successfully integrated AI capabilities into your Spring application using Ollama with Mistral AI. Experiment with different AI tasks and customize the integration to suit your specific use case.
